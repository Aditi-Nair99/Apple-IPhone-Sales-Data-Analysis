🔎 Problems Solved in This Project
1️⃣ Problem: Hard to Understand Sales Performance

Raw sales data is messy and difficult to understand.

✅ Solution:
Cleaned the dataset and created visual charts to clearly show:

Top selling iPhone models

Total sales per model

Rating distribution

Price comparison

2️⃣ Problem: No Clear View of Customer Ratings

Companies need to know:

Are customers satisfied?

Do ratings affect sales?

✅ Solution:
Created rating distribution graphs and analyzed:

Which phones have higher ratings

Relationship between ratings and number of reviews

This helps businesses understand customer satisfaction levels.

3️⃣ Problem: Pricing Strategy is Not Clear

Companies must know:

Are higher-priced phones selling more?

Does lower pricing increase demand?

✅ Solution:
Analyzed price vs sales using visualizations to understand:

Which price range performs best

How pricing impacts buying behavior

4️⃣ Problem: No Interactive Data View

Static analysis is not enough for decision-making.

✅ Solution:
Built an interactive dashboard using Streamlit where users can:

View different charts

Analyze multiple models

Understand data easily

📊 Key Insights

Some mid-range iPhones perform better than expensive ones.

Higher ratings often lead to more reviews and better sales.

Customers are price-sensitive but also value brand trust.
